---- QUERY
# Regression test for IMPALA-2256. Join whose right side has very high
# cardinality (60M) and zero materialized slots.
# Because the right side of the join here is always
# the same key, this query can run out of memory and fail to spill; see
# IMPALA-4857. The cardinality (60M) is chosen so that the test
# runs when impalad has a 7.8GB memlimit. (The peak memory usage
# of the relevant fragment is 3.6GB when tested.)
