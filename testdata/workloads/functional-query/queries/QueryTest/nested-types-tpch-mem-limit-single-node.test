# IMPALA-2376: run scan that constructs large collection and set memory limit low enough
# to get the below query to consistently fail when allocating a large collection. Set
# num_nodes to 1 in the python test and mt_dop to 1 here in order to make the query as
# deterministic as possible. mem_limit is tuned for a 3-node HDFS minicluster.
