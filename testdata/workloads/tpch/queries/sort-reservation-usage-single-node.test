---- QUERY
# Test that in-mem sorts incrementally give up memory when emitting output.
# This query and scratch limit are chosen so that the query fails if the first sort
# does not give up memory to the second sort. Scans the text formatted file so that
# the scan uses less reservation.
# num_nodes = 1 is set for this file by the python test.
