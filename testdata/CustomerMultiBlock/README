This file is created to test IMPALA-4993. The file contains a subset
of tpch_nested_parquet.customer, but written out using multiple row
groups. The file was created by following the instructions in
testdata/bin/load_nested.py to create the table, tmp_customer, which
is then written out in parquet format using hive:

SET parquet.block.size=8192;

CREATE TABLE customer
STORED AS PARQUET
TBLPROPERTIES('parquet.compression'='SNAPPY')
AS SELECT * FROM tmp_customer where c_custkey < 200;
