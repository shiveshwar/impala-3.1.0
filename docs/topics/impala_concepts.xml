    <p>
      The following sections provide background information to help you become productive using Impala and
      its features. Where appropriate, the explanations include context to help understand how aspects of Impala
      relate to other technologies you might already be familiar with, such as relational database management
      systems and data warehouses, or other Hadoop components such as Hive, HDFS, and HBase.
